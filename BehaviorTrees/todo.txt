TO DO
- refactor the tree to be an AgentComponent instead of an outside object if possible
- refactor how the tree is built, to make it easier to understand
- create a couple trees
- fix the crash that happens when you exit the scenes (happens when game is adding the trees while you exit it)
- add more decorator nodes (differenciate between exit when false, wait for event when false)
CLEANUP
- clear all the commited code from tests
- refactor notification for descriptors and listeners
- remove the Tree property from most objects if they don't need it

TESTING
- delete objects when exiting a scene - check for memory leaks by opening & ending scenes multiple times
- move nodes when one finishes - check with a more complicated tree
