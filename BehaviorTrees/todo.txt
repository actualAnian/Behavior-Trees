TO DO
- refactor the tree to be an AgentComponent instead of an outside object if possible
- create a couple trees
CLEANUP
- clear all the commited code from tests

TESTING
- delete objects when exiting a scene - check for memory leaks by opening & ending scenes multiple times
- move nodes when one finishes - check with a more complicated tree
